; This snippet will destructively store 1 if RAX contains a non-zero value,
; which is similar to C's integer conversion for boolean types (C11 ยง6.3.1.2).
; When RAX contains 0, NEG will set CF to 1, which is then added to RAX before
; subtracting from itself. This results in -1 in RAX, which is then negated
; back to 0 indicating a "false" value.
;
; This is exceptionally clever and the first time I've seen SBB used this way.
; I like that this uses a single register and does not require a branch.
